# Spatial heterogeneity in carbohydrates and their utilisation by microbial communities in the high North Atlantic

This repository contains detailed descriptions of the bioinformatic and statistical analysis as well as access to necessary datafiles in order to replicate the pipeline and results presented in our manuscript.

There are three distinct sections to the analysis, each encapsulated on a different wiki page within this repository. The sections include:

1) [Metagenomic long-read taxonomic and functional profiling](https://github.com/tpriest0/FRAM_STRAIT_WSC20_data_analysis/wiki/Metagenomic-long-read-taxonomic-and-functional-profiling) : detailed description along with code used to functionally and taxonomically annotate metagenomic HiFi reads.

2) [Ribosomal protein analysis to assess community diversity and complexity()

3) [Metagenome assembled genome recovery](https://github.com/tpriest0/FRAM_STRAIT_WSC20_data_analysis/wiki/Metagenome-assembled-genome-recovery-pipeline) : detailed description of pipeline used to recover metagenome-assembled genomes, including the lines of code used to run the employed tools.  

5) [Replicating the statistical analysis and producing the figures presented in the manuscript](https://github.com/tpriest0/FRAM_STRAIT_WSC20_data_analysis/wiki/Statistical_analysis_and_figure_creation)
