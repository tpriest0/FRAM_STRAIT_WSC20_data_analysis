This directory contains all of the necessary files to run the R scripts provided. The contents of this directory should be downloaded into a single, local directory and provided as the working directory for the R scripts. The ctd_profiles also need to be downloaded (if you wish to recreate the profiles in Figure 1). Currently, the ctd_profiles are compressed (.zip) due to file size. Download the ctd_profiles directory and unzip the files within.
